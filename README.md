# Domain Driven Design

## Studies based in day 1-2 of 100 Days System Design for DevOps and Cloud Engineers.

### https://deoshankar.medium.com/100-days-system-design-for-devops-and-cloud-engineers-18af7a80bc6f

#### Days 1–10: Advanced Architectural Concepts.
#### Day 1–2: Deep dive into Domain-Driven Design (DDD) concepts and implement in a sample application.

#### Domain Layer: Business logic lives. It should be independent of any framework or database technology.
#### Application Layer: Orchestrates your business logic. Interacts with the domain layer and infrastructure but doesn't contain business logic itself.
#### Infrastructure Layer: Handles external concerns like databases, messaging, and web frameworks.

#### This DDD app is supposed to make me practice my DevOps game and think about how to separate concerns and how to give scalability to services so maybe it's not working and making it work or being perfect is not the reason I'm doing this.

#### Also did some testing with GitHub Actions

#### Maybe soon enough I'll improve this repository into some functional DDD + CI/CD
